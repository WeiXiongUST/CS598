## Structure 

The initial release of tis project focus on the Bradley-Terry reward modeling and pairwise preference model. Since then, we have included more advanced techniques to construct preference model. The structure of this project is 

- [`annotate_data`](./annotate_data/) to annotate the data by different types of preference models.
- [`pattern_summarization`](./pattern_summarization/) to summarize the ratio of samples containing different types of patterns;
- [`rlhf`](./rlhf/) to train the policy model by either PPO or DPO.

## Installation instructions

It is recommeded to create separate environmnets for the RLHF training and evaluation. Please refer to the corresponding section for detailed instructions.
